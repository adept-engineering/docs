Kontratar is a Generative AI application that enables your business, organization, or company to research proposals all from a centralized source. The platform combines capture management, proposal development, and resource planning into one powerful tool, making it the only solution to combine these three activities. With Kontratar, businesses can quickly identify and track opportunities that match their capabilities, individually or in collaboration with partners.

The solution also provides additional opportunities based on the organization and its partners' strengths. Beyond tracking and bidding for contract opportunities, Kontratar supports project collaboration, a feature many competitors lack. This ensures that teams and partners work together efficiently throughout the process.

Additionally, the platform provides valuable historical insights on agency-issued opportunities, helping users stay ahead of the competition.
