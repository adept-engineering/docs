title: "Team Simulation"
description: "The Team Simulation feature allows you to test how well your organization (or a potential partner) aligns with a specific government opportunity. It helps you assess proposal readiness, compare capabilities, and identify the strongest team or partner for submission."
---

### **What It Does**

- Analyzes your organization's fit based on opportunity requirements
- Compares your capabilities with those of other partners
- Helps you select the most suitable team or collaborator for a given contract

Each opportunity may have its own set of requirements (e.g., _“Proposal should not exceed 12 pages”_), and the simulation will check how well you meet those criteria.

### **How to Run a Simulation**
