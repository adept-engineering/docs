### **Proposal Generation Types**

Kontratar allows flexibility in how you generate your documents. You can choose from:

1. **Full Proposal**
   - A complete, AI-generated draft based on opportunity details and your company profile
2. **Table of Contents**
   - Only the structural outline of the proposal is to guide your internal drafting.
3. **Requirements-Only**
   - Extracted requirements from the solicitation for manual response
