title: " Self-Hosting User Guidele"
description: "Welcome to the Kontratar Self-Hosting Guide. This documentation is designed to walk you through setting up your own private instance of the Kontratar platform. It covers prerequisites, environment configuration, security, installation, and deployment."
---

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure your environment meets the following:

### System Requirements

- OS: Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL
- RAM: Minimum 8 GB
- Disk: 10 GB free
  The imporant thing is for the system to support Linux and Docker.

### Software Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.8\+
- Git
- Liquibase (For Database Configuration Setup)
- Internet access

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Database Setup

- A running PostgreSQL database (self-hosted or cloud e.g. AWS RDS)
- SSL certificate (`.crt`) to verify DB connection

### 2. SMTP Setup

- SMTP credentials for sending notification emails (optional but recommended)

### 3. Redis

- Redis host and credentials (cloud-based or self-hosted)

### 4. Domain Name

- A domain name with it required certificate to verifying the domain connection.

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download the Installer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kontratar-installer.git
cd kontratar-installer

# Please note the actual link would be updated later. 
```

### 2. Make the Installer Executable (Linux/macOS)

```bash
chmod +x install.py
```

### 3. Run the Installer

```bash
python3 install.py
```

You will be prompted to enter:

- Base port for the application (e.g. 3000)
- Domain name for the self-hosted app (e.g. example.yourdomain.com) and optional SSL cert path
- PostgreSQL host, user, password, SSL cert path
- Redis host, port, password
- SMTP host, user, password, port

The installer will:

- Dynamically authenticate and access the Docker registry
- Download and run Liquibase schema setup
- Generate an `.env` file for environment variables
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with dynamic port mapping
- Pull and run all required containers

---

## ðŸ”„ Port Mapping

All services are offset from your base port (e.g. 3000):

| Service             | Port Offset | Final Port |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Frontend            | \+0         | 3000       |
| Auth Service        | \+1         | 3001       |
| Opps Controller     | \+2         | 3002       |
| SAM Data Feed       | \+3         | 3003       |
| SAM to Repository   | \+4         | 3004       |
| Opportunity Service | \+5         | 3005       |
| Award Repository    | \+6         | 3006       |
| Information Service | \+7         | 3007       |
| API Gateway         | \+8         | 3008       |

It is very important to note this ports, so understand where each service of the containers would be running.

## ðŸ”— Accessing Your App

Once containers are running, access the kontratar platform though:

```url
https://<your-domain>:<base-port>
```

You can verify service health with:

```bash
curl https://<your-domain>:3001/api/checkalive       # Auth service and other services
curl https://<your-domain>:3008/api/gateway/checkalive # Specific for api service          
```

You can run the following to verify containers:

```bash
docker ps                 # List running containers
docker logs <container>  # Inspect logs
```

---

## Maintenance & Troubleshooting

### Restarting Services

```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

### Checking Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs -f <service_name>
```

### Check Container Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs -f <service_name>
```

### Updating Environment

Edit `.env` and re-run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Re-running the Installer

To change configs completely, stop the running services with

```bash
docker-compose down
```

And then delete `.env` and `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
rm .env docker-compose.yml
python3 install.py
```
