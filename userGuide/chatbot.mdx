- The AI assistant will immediately analyze the contract details and return an accurate, context-specific answer.

The chatbot functions like any standard LLM-based app, such as ChatGPT. No specific commands are required, just type naturally. Ask the chatbot for assistance with proposal writing, formatting, or best practices. Ensure your questions are clear and explicitly state what you expect from the chatbot for the best results.
