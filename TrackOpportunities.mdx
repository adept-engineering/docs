4. To track an opportunity, select **“Proceed to Track”**—it will move to your **My Desk** for follow-up.
5. You can also use the **filter** tool to narrow opportunities by:
   - **NAICS codes**
   - **Agencies** (e.g., Department of Defense)
6. You can also view posting dates and apply date filters from the **Home** tab (e.g., last 24 hours, last 7 days).
7. Users can filter out opportunities based on agencies, NAICS code, e.t.c. 

<Note>
  Users can generate or create a response/proposal.
