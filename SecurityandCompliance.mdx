### **Two-factor Authentication**

* To ensure that the application has a deeper security, we strongly encourage users to enable the two-factor authentication to login

* Navigate to profile and then settings/security

* Click on Generate Code under Setup 2-factor authentication

* Then scan the generated qrcode and scan with any authenticator application you use. (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) and enter in the 6-digits generated code to verify that you have successfuly scanned the code

### Passphrase security for proposals

* Proposal documents are highly sensitive documents by nature

* We mitigate that by ensuring that every tenant has a unique passphrase in which you have to enter before starting the generation proposal, viewing sections of proposals, and downloading proposals

* To get a passphrase, Navigate to profile and then settings/security

* Click on Generate Public Private Key Pair

* **Please Keep your passphrase safe. We do not store it. If you forget your passphrase, your generated proposals would be lost.**

* We do not store the passphrase, only the password has, and that is what is used to decrypt the keys used to encrypt the proposals

* We only show the public key used to encrypt proposals
