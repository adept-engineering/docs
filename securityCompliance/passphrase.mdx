### Passphrase security for proposals

* Proposal documents are highly sensitive documents by nature

* We mitigate that by ensuring that every tenant has a unique passphrase in which you have to enter before starting the generation proposal, viewing sections of proposals, and downloading proposals

* To get a passphrase, Navigate to profile and then settings/security

* Click on Generate Public Private Key Pair

* **Please Keep your passphrase safe. We do not store it. If you forget your passphrase, your generated proposals would be lost.**

* We do not store the passphrase, only the password has, and that is what is used to decrypt the keys used to encrypt the proposals

* We only show the public key used to encrypt proposals
