### Passphrase security for proposals

- Proposal documents are highly sensitive documents by nature
- We mitigate that by ensuring that every tenant has a unique passphrase, which you have to enter before starting the generation proposal, viewing sections of proposals, and downloading proposals
- To get a passphrase, navigate to profile and then click on settings, then security.
- Click on Generate Public Private Key Pair

<Warning>
  Please keep your passphrase safe. We do not store it. If you forget your passphrase, your generated proposals would be lost.
</Warning>

<Info>
  We do not store the passphrase, only the password hash, which is used to decrypt the keys that encrypt the proposals.

<Note>
  We only show the public key used to encrypt proposals.
