### Passphrase security for proposals

* Proposal documents are highly sensitive documents by nature

* We mitigate that by ensuring that every tenant has a unique passphrase in which you have to enter before starting the generation proposal, viewing sections of proposals, and downloading proposals

* To get a passphrase, Navigate to profile and then click on setting, then security.&#x20;

* Click on Generate Public Private Key Pair

<Warning>
Please keep your passphrase safe. We do not store it. If you forget your passphrase, your generated proposals would be lost.
</Warning>

<Info>
We do not store the passphrase, only the password hash, which is used to decrypt the keys that encrypt the proposals.

<Note>
We only show the public key used to encrypt proposals.
